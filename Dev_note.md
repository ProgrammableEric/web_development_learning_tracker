<h2>Frontend Development Note </2>

<h3>How are scripts loaded? </h3>
Browser parses the HTML elements in their apperance order in HTML file. Same for <code><script></code> element. If one script is
dependant on another, then they will be loaded sequentically as well, causing a delay and bad user experience. 

<h3> var, const, let</h3>
<p> <em>var: </em>Prior to ES6 standard, was the only keyword for declaring variables.
<br> <em>const: </em>a const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. 
<br> <em>let: </em> variable can be reassigned a different value. </p>
