### The Web Server
A _web server_ is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses. 
_Protocal_ is the specific format of a request. (e.g., HTTP request) 

### The Application Server 
The collection of programming logic required to deliver dynamic content to a client, manage security, process payments, and myriad other tasks is sometimes known as the “application” or _application server_. 
The application server can be responsible for anything from sending an email confirmation after a purchase to running the complicated algorithms a search engine uses to give us meaningful results.
 
### API - Application Program Interface 接口
A **web API** is a collection of predefined ways of, or rules for, interacting with a web application’s data, often through an HTTP request-response cycle. API can be made public or internally limited access. 

### Authentication and Authorisation 
_Authentication_ is the process of validating the identity of a user. One technique for authentication is to use logins with usernames and passwords.
_Authorization_ controls which users have access to which resources and actions. Certain application views, like the page to edit a social media personal profile, are only accessible to that user. Other activities, like deleting a post, are often similarly restricted.

## Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript _runtime_, or an environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. A “runtime” converts code written in a _high-level_, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute.
