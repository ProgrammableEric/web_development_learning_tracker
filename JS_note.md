<h2>JS NOTE</h2> 

<h3> Passing by value vs. passing by reference</h3>
In Javascript, The only elements that are not objects are the Primitive Data Types : 
<b>string, number, boolean, null and undefined. </b>Primitive Data Types are passed <i>By Value</i> 
and Objects are passed <i>By Reference</i>. 

<h3> var, const, let</h3>
<p> <em>var: </em>Prior to ES6 standard, was the only keyword for declaring variables.
<br> <em>const: </em>a const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. 
<br> <em>let: </em> variable can be reassigned a different value. </p>
