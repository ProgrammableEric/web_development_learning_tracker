<h2>JS NOTE</h2> 

<h4> Passing by value vs. passing by reference</h4>
In Javascript, The only elements that are not objects are the Primitive Data Types : 
<b>string, number, boolean, null and undefined. </b>Primitive Data Types are passed <i>By Value</i> 
and Objects are passed <i>By Reference</i>.
