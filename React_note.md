<h1>Library and Framework </h1>

A Library is a bunch of reusable code. With a library, you are calling the library's code. However, a frame work is the sturcture of 
something that allow you to fill the important content to make the application complete based on the structure given. Using a 
framework means you are called by the framework' code.

<h1>First Look on React </h1>

<h2>JSX</h2>
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML. If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.
<h3>JSX Element </h3> 
<ul>
  <li>Elements are treated as JavaScript expressions, meaning that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or arrayâ€¦</li>
  <li>Wrap multi-lined JSX element into <code>( )</code></li>
  <li>a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.</li>
  <li><code>ReactDOM.render(JSX element, document.getElementById('app'));</code> </li> 
  <li><b>Virtual DOM: </b> React has Virtual DOM as a blueprint of the real DOM. Manipulating Virtual DOM is much faster than real DOM. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-virtual-dom">example1 </a>, <a href="https://reactkungfu.com/2015/10/the-difference-between-virtual-dom-and-dom/">example2 </a></li>.
